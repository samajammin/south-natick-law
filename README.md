# South Natick Law
Small Firm Attention, Big Firm Sophistication

## The Project
[SouthNatickLaw.com](http://www.southnaticklaw.com/) is a clean, professional web application and CMS powered by Django, Bootstrap & AWS. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database & uses the Django mailer for lead form tracking, management & email communication. The customized Bootstrap design (template courtesy of [Peter Finlan](http://tympanus.net/Freebies/HalcyonDaysTemplate/)), provides a modern feel with slick transitions using [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), JavaScript, jQuery & graceful degredation with [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/). Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with S3 for static files & media storage.
